# TPMS---Tire-Prussure-Monitoring-System
The project displays the air pressure gauge in the vehicle wheels in real-time. 
The project focuses on development and implementation of a system that meets this requirement,
by using wireless communication in the local area (wireless LAN) between the transmitter,
which receives data from the sensor, and a receiver connected to the monitor, 
and the data translation algorithm from the receiver to the LCD. 
Data processing is done using Arduino and an algorithem in C.

If you have more questions about the code or anything you are more them welcome send me a mail :)
